To everyone who has ever crossed a border, loved someone who left, or wondered what truly happens after a deportation order is signed: this report is for you.

> **About The Mexico Deportee Coalition (TMDC)**
> 
> The Mexico Deportee Coalition is an emerging, nonpartisan effort dedicated to documenting the realities of deportation between the United States and Mexico, supporting deportees and their families, and advancing solutions grounded in evidence rather than ideology. At this stage TMDC is one person’s evolving vision for how to help address a severe and growing problem, shared publicly in the hope of sparking a broader, cross‑border coalition. This report aims to remain as unbiased as possible and to base every major claim on publicly available data, peer‑reviewed research, and documented government records. It is not legal advice, is not a substitute for professional counsel, and is not legally binding in any way. Errors or omissions are possible; this document is offered for educational purposes, early‑stage fundraising, and awareness‑building only.

### A Note from the Author

My name is Paul Green. I grew up a country boy in North Carolina, in a family where faith, hard work, and showing up for people in hard times were not ideas but habits. In 2017, I packed up my life in the United States and came to Mexico, landing in Guanajuato for what I thought would be a temporary adventure. Somewhere between watching the sun set over the tunnels, getting lost in the alleys, and being welcomed into ordinary daily rhythms, that “temporary adventure” quietly became home. [web:273]

Since late 2020 and early 2021, I have run a small, low‑cost business helping people relocate to Mexico and helping those already here make sense of visas, neighborhoods, and everyday realities. Over these years I have talked with countless would‑be movers and new arrivals. Watching them build full, joyful lives in Guanajuato and beyond has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life; it means being a tiny part of someone else’s success story, not just my own. The service is simple in design but deep in content: hard‑earned knowledge, personal experience, and years of building networks and asking questions about what it really takes to move to Mexico and thrive. [web:273]

Unlike high‑priced facilitators who charge hundreds of dollars to answer basic questions, I have tried to keep my support accessible and grounded in real life. Much of what I share is about culture and history, local events, and the small details of daily life that make Guanajuato feel like home rather than a beautiful backdrop. I manage a Facebook community (“Guanajuato Expats, Guanajuatenses, and Visitors”) and a Skool community called “Wonderful Guanajuato,” where I write guides and essays about this city that has given me so much joy, wonder, and apapacho. [web:273]

Alongside all of that, another reality has become impossible to ignore: deportees returning to Mexico from the United States, often with U.S. citizen children, broken families, and no clear next step. They are in border shelters and small interior towns, on buses and in factories, in call centers and in informal jobs. Many are scared, disoriented, and grieving. Too often, they are invisible or reduced to a statistic. [web:218][web:273]

The Mexico Deportee Coalition is my attempt to respond to that reality with the tools I have: words, relationships, and stubborn hope. I am a conservative, southern, Christian, white man from the United States who now calls Mexico home; part of what moves me is knowing that not all Americans believe deportees are unwelcome, disposable, or beyond redemption. Deportees deserve dignity, opportunity, and a real chance to rebuild. Getting deported is often catastrophic in the short term, but for those who are ambitious and willing to adapt, it does not have to be the end of their story. In some cases, it can become another kind of cross‑border success story, not so different from the voluntary moves I have helped people make for years. [web:273]

For years I have helped people—with options, passports, and resources—move to Mexico by choice and build good lives here. The deportees this report is about rarely had the luxury of choice, planning, or a soft landing. My hope is that, over time, this coalition can help change that: a cross‑border, cross‑culture effort, a deportee support network that is actually connected—the “Deportee Directory”—and eventually a podcast where deportees and their families can speak for themselves about what happens when a life is ripped out from under them, and how they build again. [web:205][web:218]

I expect to be just one of many members in this coalition, not its center. My role is to help remind deportees that they are not alone, that there are people they have never met who carry real sympathy and real hope for them. Not all Americans believe they are unwanted—even people from the South like me. This report is one way of saying exactly that.

With gratitude to Guanajuato, to every deportee who has trusted me with their story, and to anyone willing to read this with an open mind,

## FRONT MATTER

### About The Mexico Deportee Coalition

The Mexico Deportee Coalition (TMDC) is a nonpartisan organization dedicated to documenting the reality of deportations, supporting communities affected by enforcement, and advancing policy solutions grounded in evidence rather than politics. Operating at the intersection of the United States and Mexico, TMDC seeks to understand what actually happens when the U.S. deports people—not what politicians claim happens, but what evidence shows. [web:273][web:263]

**Our Mission**: To generate rigorous, independent research on deportation policies and their impacts; to amplify the voices and experiences of affected communities; and to advocate for policies that prioritize human dignity, family unity, and evidence‑based solutions. [web:273]

**Our Values**:  
- **Truth above politics**: Report what data show, regardless of which administration initiated policies. [web:293]  
- **Evidence first**: Ground every major claim in verifiable data, academic research, or documented government records. [web:263][web:346]  
- **Human dignity**: Center the voices and humanity of those affected by deportation. [web:4][web:218]  
- **Accountability**: Document abuses, costs, and failures without regard to political affiliation. [web:11][web:271]  
- **Solutions focus**: Identify what works and what could work better, in both the United States and Mexico. [web:273][web:205]

**Our Commitment**: This report strives to meet high standards of academic and journalistic rigor for a small, emerging initiative. Sources are cited transparently, limitations and uncertainties are acknowledged, and critique and additional evidence are welcomed. [web:293]

> **Important Notice on Legal Status, Contributions, and Liability**  
> TMDC is in the early stages of formalizing its structure and pursuing 501(c)(3) status in the United States. Nothing in this document constitutes legal advice, tax advice, financial advice, or a binding promise of services. Readers should consult qualified professionals before making legal, financial, or immigration decisions. Any financial contributions made in response to this report are voluntary, will be used to help design, launch, and stabilize this project, and **are not tax‑deductible at this time**. Once nonprofit status is secured, future contributions may qualify as charitable gifts under applicable law, but no guarantees can be made here. Any errors identified should be reported to PaulGreen@MexicoDeporteeCoalition.com so they can be corrected in future editions. [web:293]

### How to Read This Report

**What This Report Is**:  
- A comprehensive, evidence‑based analysis of Trump‑era deportation policies in the second administration (2025–present) and their impacts across multiple dimensions. [web:14][web:9][web:11]  
- An integrated examination of both undocumented immigrant removals and the unfolding crisis facing DACA recipients and other long‑term residents with precarious legal status. [web:232][web:292][web:294]  
- A synthesis of U.S. and Mexican government data, peer‑reviewed research, organizational reports, and ground‑level observations in Mexican communities receiving deportees. [web:263][web:273][web:261][web:205]  
- A nonpartisan factual document designed to inform policy decisions, public understanding, and early‑stage philanthropic and community responses. [web:293]  
- A resource for policymakers, researchers, advocates, deportees, families, faith communities, and donors seeking to respond in concrete, constructive ways.

**What This Report Is NOT**:  
- A partisan attack on any administration or a defense of any political party. [web:293]  
- A prediction of exact future deportation totals, which depend on policy, budgets, court rulings, and broader economic conditions. [web:341]  
- A comprehensive legal guide or substitute for individualized legal counsel.  
- A replacement for the testimony and leadership of deportees themselves; rather, it is intended to clear space and provide context for those voices.

**How Sources Are Used**:  
- Major claims are backed by at least one credible source, such as U.S. agency data, Mexican government statistics, peer‑reviewed studies, or recognized advocacy and research organizations. [web:263][web:346][web:261][web:273]  
- Where official figures and independent estimates diverge—for example around the true number of removals, the composition of the detained population, or the capacity of Mexico’s “México te abraza” program—the report presents both and explains likely reasons for the gap (definitions, timeframes, methodology, or politics). [web:14][web:9][web:205][web:218][web:298]  
- When evidence is incomplete or contested, findings are framed cautiously, and the uncertainty is highlighted so readers understand where the ground is firm and where it is still shifting.

**Data Currency**: The analysis reflects information available through December 2025, including ICE and CBP data releases analyzed by journalists and researchers, updated DACA status explainers, and recent assessments of Mexico’s reception and reintegration strategies. [web:9][web:14][web:232][web:292][web:273][web:218]

### Evidence and Neutrality

This report takes positions on facts, not parties. Wherever possible, it compares deportation, detention, and DACA trends across multiple administrations using the best available figures from official U.S. and Mexican sources, independent monitoring projects, and peer‑reviewed work. [web:263][web:346][web:294][web:273]

When numbers differ—for example between administration claims and independent estimates of removals, or between Mexican government announcements and on‑the‑ground evaluations of programs like “México te abraza”—the discrepancy is spelled out rather than glossed over. Methods, timeframes, and definitions are explained so readers can see why numbers do or do not line up. [web:14][web:11][web:205][web:218][web:298]

No report written by a human being can be perfectly free of bias, and this one is no exception. It reflects an author who lives in Mexico, works with would‑be movers and some deportees, and is committed to the dignity of migrants. That is why critique is not only tolerated but invited: readers are encouraged to send corrections, additional data, or alternative interpretations to PaulGreen@MexicoDeporteeCoalition.com so that future editions can be more accurate, complete, and fair‑minded.
