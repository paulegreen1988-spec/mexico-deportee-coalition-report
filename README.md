### A Note from the Author

My name is Paul Green. I grew up a country boy in North Carolina, in a family where faith, hard work, and showing up for people in hard times were not ideas but habits. In 2017, I packed up my life in the United States and came to Mexico, landing in Guanajuato for what I thought would be a temporary adventure. Somewhere between watching the sun set over the tunnels, getting lost in the alleys, and being welcomed into ordinary daily rhythms, that “temporary adventure” quietly became home. [web:273]

Since late 2020 and early 2021, I have run a small, low‑cost business helping people relocate to Mexico and helping those already here make sense of visas, neighborhoods, and everyday realities. Over these years I have talked with countless would‑be movers and new arrivals. Watching them build full, joyful lives in Guanajuato and beyond has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life; it means being a tiny part of someone else’s success story, not just my own. The service is simple in design but deep in content: hard‑earned knowledge, personal experience, and years of building networks and asking questions about what it really takes to move to Mexico and thrive. [web:273]

Unlike high‑priced facilitators who charge hundreds of dollars to answer basic questions, I have tried to keep my support accessible and grounded in real life. Much of what I share is about culture and history, local events, and the small details of daily life that make Guanajuato feel like home rather than a beautiful backdrop. I manage a Facebook community (“Guanajuato Expats, Guanajuatenses, and Visitors”) and a Skool community called “Wonderful Guanajuato,” where I write guides and essays about this city that has given me so much joy, wonder, and apapacho. [web:273]

Alongside all of that, another reality has become impossible to ignore: deportees returning to Mexico from the United States, often with U.S. citizen children, broken families, and no clear next step. They are in border shelters and small interior towns, on buses and in factories, in call centers and in informal jobs. Many are scared, disoriented, and grieving. Too often, they are invisible or reduced to a statistic. [web:218][web:273]

The Mexico Deportee Coalition is my attempt to respond to that reality with the tools I have: words, relationships, and stubborn hope. I am a conservative, southern, Christian, white man from the United States who now calls Mexico home; part of what moves me is knowing that not all Americans believe deportees are unwelcome, disposable, or beyond redemption. Deportees deserve dignity, opportunity, and a real chance to rebuild. Getting deported is often catastrophic in the short term, but for those who are ambitious and willing to adapt, it does not have to be the end of their story. In some cases, it can become another kind of cross‑border success story, not so different from the voluntary moves I have helped people make for years. [web:273]

For years I have helped people—with options, passports, and resources—move to Mexico by choice and build good lives here. The deportees this report is about rarely had the luxury of choice, planning, or a soft landing. My hope is that, over time, this coalition can help change that: a cross‑border, cross‑culture effort, a deportee support network that is actually connected—the “Deportee Directory”—and eventually a podcast where deportees and their families can speak for themselves about what happens when a life is ripped out from under them, and how they build again. [web:205][web:218]

I expect to be just one of many members in this coalition, not its center. My role is to help remind deportees that they are not alone, that there are people they have never met who carry real sympathy and real hope for them. Not all Americans believe they are unwanted—even people from the South like me. This report is one way of saying exactly that.

With gratitude to Guanajuato, to every deportee who has trusted me with their story, and to anyone willing to read this with an open mind,

## Executive Summary

**Key Findings**
- **Deportation capacity, not rhetoric, sets the ceiling.** Despite escalated directives, total removals remain constrained by detention beds, court throughput, and transport limits, keeping annual totals below prior peaks. ([Part One](#part-one-historical-architecture-and-policy-evolution))
- **Interior arrests now dominate enforcement.** The current approach prioritizes removals from settled U.S. communities rather than recent border crossers, intensifying disruption for long‑term residents. ([Part One](#part-one-historical-architecture-and-policy-evolution))
- **Most deportees are not serious public‑safety threats.** Large shares of those detained or removed have no criminal record or only minor offenses, despite stated priorities to target violent offenders. ([Part Two](#part-two-who-is-being-deported))
- **Detention inflicts preventable harm.** Evidence of medical neglect, solitary confinement, and avoidable deaths highlights the human and fiscal costs of detention over community‑based alternatives. ([Part Three](#part-three-the-detention-crisis))
- **Family separation remains the deepest scar.** An estimated 5.9 million U.S. citizen children live with at least one undocumented caregiver and face acute psychological and educational risks when families are divided. ([Part Four](#part-four-family-dissolution-and-psychological-trauma))
- **The economy relies on undocumented labor.** Key sectors and local economies depend on undocumented workers, making large‑scale removals a threat to U.S. productivity and price stability. ([Part Five](#part-five-the-economic-role-of-undocumented-workers))
- **DACA recipients face unprecedented vulnerability.** Hundreds of thousands of long‑settled Dreamers risk losing work authorization and could be removed to countries they barely know. ([Part Seven](#part-seven-the-daca-crisiswhen-legal-status-holders-face-deportation))

**Actionable Recommendations**
- **Create durable status for long‑settled residents, including DACA recipients.** Pair legislative reform with streamlined relief pathways to stabilize families and employers. ([Part Ten](#part-ten-synthesis-recommendations-and-the-path-forward))
- **Replace punitive detention with humane, community‑based models.** Expand case management, legal access, and medical oversight to cut costs and prevent abuse. ([Part Three](#part-three-the-detention-crisis))
- **Invest in reception and reintegration in Mexico.** Scale coordinated housing, credentialing, and mental‑health support so deportees and returnees can rebuild safely. ([Part Six](#part-six-the-post-deportation-crisis))
- **Fund community defense and data transparency.** Resource local legal networks, publish consistent enforcement metrics, and ensure impacted voices shape policy. ([Part Nine](#part-nine-the-resistance-and-solutions))

**Headline Metrics**
- **2.7–3 million removals during 2009–2017** provide the modern baseline and illustrate how capacity, not promises, caps annual deportations. ([Part One](#part-one-historical-architecture-and-policy-evolution))
- **5.9 million U.S. citizen children** live with an undocumented caregiver and are exposed to the trauma of forced separation. ([Part Four](#part-four-family-dissolution-and-psychological-trauma))
- **Just over 500,000 active DACA recipients in 2025**—many with 20+ years in the United States—could lose protections without durable status. ([Appendix A](#appendix-a-key-statistics-table))

## FRONT MATTER

### About The Mexico Deportee Coalition

The Mexico Deportee Coalition (TMDC) is a nonpartisan organization dedicated to documenting the reality of deportations, supporting communities affected by enforcement, and advancing policy solutions grounded in evidence rather than politics. Operating at the intersection of the United States and Mexico, TMDC seeks to understand what actually happens when the U.S. deports people—not what politicians claim happens, but what evidence shows. [web:273][web:263]

**Our Mission**: To generate rigorous, independent research on deportation policies and their impacts; to amplify the voices and experiences of affected communities; and to advocate for policies that prioritize human dignity, family unity, and evidence‑based solutions. [web:273]

**Our Values**:  
- **Truth above politics**: Report what data show, regardless of which administration initiated policies. [web:293]  
- **Evidence first**: Ground every major claim in verifiable data, academic research, or documented government records. [web:263][web:346]  
- **Human dignity**: Center the voices and humanity of those affected by deportation. [web:4][web:218]  
- **Accountability**: Document abuses, costs, and failures without regard to political affiliation. [web:11][web:271]  
- **Solutions focus**: Identify what works and what could work better, in both the United States and Mexico. [web:273][web:205]

**Our Commitment**: This report strives to meet high standards of academic and journalistic rigor for a small, emerging initiative. Sources are cited transparently, limitations and uncertainties are acknowledged, and critique and additional evidence are welcomed. [web:293]

### How to Read This Report

**What This Report Is**:  
- A comprehensive, evidence‑based analysis of Trump‑era deportation policies in the second administration (2025–present) and their impacts across multiple dimensions. [web:14][web:9][web:11]  
- An integrated examination of both undocumented immigrant removals and the unfolding crisis facing DACA recipients and other long‑term residents with precarious legal status. [web:232][web:292][web:294]  
- A synthesis of U.S. and Mexican government data, peer‑reviewed research, organizational reports, and ground‑level observations in Mexican communities receiving deportees. [web:263][web:273][web:261][web:205]  
- A nonpartisan factual document designed to inform policy decisions, public understanding, and early‑stage philanthropic and community responses. [web:293]  
- A resource for policymakers, researchers, advocates, deportees, families, faith communities, and donors seeking to respond in concrete, constructive ways.

**What This Report Is NOT**:  
- A partisan attack on any administration or a defense of any political party. [web:293]  
- A prediction of exact future deportation totals, which depend on policy, budgets, court rulings, and broader economic conditions. [web:341]  
- A comprehensive legal guide or substitute for individualized legal counsel.  
- A replacement for the testimony and leadership of deportees themselves; rather, it is intended to clear space and provide context for those voices.

**How Sources Are Used**:  
- Major claims are backed by at least one credible source, such as U.S. agency data, Mexican government statistics, peer‑reviewed studies, or recognized advocacy and research organizations. [web:263][web:346][web:261][web:273]  
- Where official figures and independent estimates diverge—for example around the true number of removals, the composition of the detained population, or the capacity of Mexico’s “México te abraza” program—the report presents both and explains likely reasons for the gap (definitions, timeframes, methodology, or politics). [web:14][web:9][web:205][web:218][web:298]  
- When evidence is incomplete or contested, findings are framed cautiously, and the uncertainty is highlighted so readers understand where the ground is firm and where it is still shifting.

**Data Currency**: The analysis reflects information available through December 2025, including ICE and CBP data releases analyzed by journalists and researchers, updated DACA status explainers, and recent assessments of Mexico’s reception and reintegration strategies. [web:9][web:14][web:232][web:292][web:273][web:218]

### Evidence and Neutrality

This report takes positions on facts, not parties. Wherever possible, it compares deportation, detention, and DACA trends across multiple administrations using the best available figures from official U.S. and Mexican sources, independent monitoring projects, and peer‑reviewed work. [web:263][web:346][web:294][web:273]

When numbers differ—for example between administration claims and independent estimates of removals, or between Mexican government announcements and on‑the‑ground evaluations of programs like “México te abraza”—the discrepancy is spelled out rather than glossed over. Methods, timeframes, and definitions are explained so readers can see why numbers do or do not line up. [web:14][web:11][web:205][web:218][web:298]

No report written by a human being can be perfectly free of bias, and this one is no exception. It reflects an author who lives in Mexico, works with would‑be movers and some deportees, and is committed to the dignity of migrants. That is why critique is not only tolerated but invited: readers are encouraged to send corrections, additional data, or alternative interpretations to PaulGreen@MexicoDeporteeCoalition.com so that future editions can be more accurate, complete, and fair‑minded. [web:293]

### Key Messages: For Donors, Policymakers, and Journalists

**1. The Numbers Do Not Match the Claims**  
Administration figures suggest a historic wave of removals, but careful reading of ICE and DHS data shows that the reality is far below the rhetoric once self‑deportations and survey‑based estimates are stripped out. [web:9][web:289][web:382]

**2. The Focus Is Shifting to Interior Enforcement**  
While previous eras centered on returns at or near the border, the current approach places unprecedented emphasis on arrests and removals from inside U.S. communities, workplaces, and schools, with a much larger share of people taken from settled lives rather than recent arrivals. [web:391][web:376][web:13]

**3. Who Is Being Deported Contradicts Stated Priorities**  
Despite repeated promises to target “criminal aliens,” a large proportion of those detained and removed have either no criminal record or only minor offenses that would not typically be seen as serious public‑safety threats. [web:24][web:383][web:7]

**4. Detention Is Inhumane, Expensive, and Often Unnecessary**  
Independent investigations continue to document medical neglect, solitary confinement, preventable deaths, and extreme psychological harm in immigration detention, even though community‑based alternatives are cheaper and far less damaging. [web:261][web:4][web:2]

**5. 5.9 Million U.S. Citizen Children Are at Risk**  
Millions of citizen children live with at least one undocumented caregiver, and research links forced separation and parental deportation to severe and lasting mental‑health and educational harms that can echo across a lifetime. [web:24][web:4]

**6. The Economy Needs Undocumented Workers**  
Undocumented workers are foundational to sectors like agriculture, construction, and hospitality; large‑scale removals and deterrence measures ripple through labor markets, GDP, and prices in ways that affect U.S.‑born workers as well. [web:13][web:375]

**7. Mexico Is Overwhelmed and Underfunded**  
Mexico has announced programs such as “México te abraza” and expanded reception points, but existing infrastructure and budgets fall far short of what is needed to support large numbers of deportees and returnees in a dignified way. [web:273][web:205][web:348]

**8. The DACA Crisis Is Unprecedented**  
For the first time, a large group of long‑settled residents who have enjoyed lawful presence and work authorization for years face the real possibility of losing both and being removed to countries they barely know. [web:292][web:232][web:347]

**9. Dreamer Reintegration Requires Specialized Support**  
DACA recipients and other “Dreamers” bring U.S. degrees, English‑dominant skills, and deep American roots, which means they face distinct barriers to credential recognition, professional work, and identity rebuilding if deported to Mexico. [web:294][web:273]

**10. Grassroots Resistance Is Mobilizing but Outpaced**  
Rapid response networks, legal defense funds, and local campaigns to limit cooperation with federal enforcement are active across the country, but their capacity remains small compared with the scale of arrests, detentions, and removals. [web:2][web:392]

# PART ONE: HISTORICAL ARCHITECTURE AND POLICY EVOLUTION

## Chapter 1: How We Got Here—Building the Deportation Infrastructure (1965–2024)

### The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965: Unintended Consequences

The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act ended openly racist national‑origins quotas and reshaped the legal immigration system around family ties and limited employment categories, but it did not create sufficient lawful pathways for the volume of labor migration the U.S. economy continued to demand from Mexico and other countries. [web:375][web:20] When the bracero program ended and country caps were imposed, seasonal and circular movement did not vanish; instead, the same flows increasingly occurred without authorization, laying the groundwork for a large undocumented population. [web:375]

### Reagan Era: The Enforcement Turn of the 1980s

The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 combined a one‑time legalization program with new employer sanctions meant to discourage hiring undocumented workers. [web:13][web:375] While roughly 2.7 million people regularized their status, weak workplace enforcement and persistent labor demand meant unauthorized migration continued, and the undocumented population kept growing through the 1990s despite the law’s promises. [web:375]

### The Punitive Turn: IIRIRA (1996)

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 marked a structural break in U.S. immigration enforcement, expanding the grounds of deportability, curtailing judicial discretion, and creating new fast‑track removal procedures. [web:383][web:20] By broadening the definition of “aggravated felony” and applying it retroactively, IIRIRA turned many long‑past and relatively minor convictions into automatic triggers for detention and expulsion, effectively building a pipeline from the criminal legal system into deportation. [web:383][web:389]

### Post‑9/11 Securitization (2001–2008)

After the attacks of September 11, 2001, immigration enforcement was folded into a broader security frame, leading to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the establishment of ICE and CBP, and major investments in surveillance and detention. [web:20][web:383] Programs such as Secure Communities, which linked local police bookings to immigration databases, funneled large numbers of noncitizens into removal proceedings, including many people charged only with minor offenses or none at all. [web:2][web:388]

### Obama Administration: Building Enforcement Capacity (2009–2017)

The Obama administration presided over historically high numbers of removals, with estimates of roughly 2.7 to 3 million deportations over eight years depending on how returns and formal removals are counted. [web:382][web:390] While officials emphasized a focus on people with serious criminal convictions, research shows that many deportees had lived in the United States for a decade or more and that large numbers were removed for immigration violations or lower‑level offenses. [web:24][web:6] At the same time, the administration expanded detention capacity, increased reliance on private prison contractors, and laid down biometric and data‑sharing infrastructures later administrations would inherit. [web:2][web:383]

### Trump’s First Term: Acceleration Without Structural Change (2017–2021)

During Donald Trump’s first term, total removals were lower than the Obama and Clinton eras but the tone and targeting shifted, with more arrests of people who lacked serious criminal records and a heavy emphasis on deterrence messaging. [web:28][web:13][web:385] The administration attempted to terminate DACA, implemented the “zero tolerance” policy that led to widespread family separations at the border, and used Title 42 to rapidly expel asylum seekers during the COVID‑19 pandemic. [web:340][web:4] Although promises of “millions” of deportations were not realized numerically, the threat environment for immigrants intensified and set the stage for later policies. [web:340][web:382]

### Biden Administration: Continuity and Constraint (2021–2024)

The Biden administration inherited pandemic‑era measures and a strained asylum system, initially signaling a narrower enforcement focus but continuing to carry out large numbers of removals and returns, particularly at the border. [web:376][web:28] Public debate often framed Biden’s approach as “open borders,” yet DHS statistics show significant use of expulsions and deportations, including under Title 42 until its end in 2023. [web:9][web:382] Efforts to narrow interior enforcement through guidance were challenged and partly constrained by litigation from certain states, illustrating how much immigration policy now runs through the courts. [web:22][web:343]

### 2025: Trump’s Second Term and the Use of Existing Systems

When Trump returned to office in January 2025, he inherited a robust enforcement architecture: tens of thousands of detention beds, mature data systems linking local police and immigration databases, and legal authorities expanded since the 1990s. [web:11][web:391] Early actions in the second term did not create new legal categories so much as remove prosecutorial discretion and directive limits, signaling that anyone without lawful status could be a target and directing ICE to use its full existing authority. [web:343][web:391] In practice, this has meant a sharper turn toward interior arrests and a more punitive stance toward long‑settled residents, even as total removal numbers remain bounded by capacity, budgets, and due‑process requirements. [web:391][web:289]

---

## Chapter 2: The Numerical Reality—Claims Versus Evidence

### The “Millions Deported” Narrative

Campaign speeches and some official statements portray current enforcement as an unprecedented mass deportation campaign, often citing figures in the millions without clarifying what is being counted. [web:11][web:340] Independent analysts point out that such numbers usually mix formal removals, border returns, voluntary departures, and survey‑based estimates of “self‑deportation,” making it difficult for the public to understand what has actually happened. [web:9][web:382]

### What the Data Show So Far

ICE, CBP, and related DHS components publish removal and apprehension statistics that, while imperfect, allow a clearer picture of recent trends when interpreted carefully. [web:346][web:373] Early 2025 figures indicate that removals have risen compared with the low points of the pandemic and early Biden years and are on track to approach or exceed the higher levels of the mid‑2010s, but they remain below the all‑time peaks reached under Clinton and Obama. [web:9][web:376][web:382] Where the second Trump administration stands out is not total volume alone, but the geographic and legal character of removals—more from the interior, and many involving people with deep ties to U.S. communities. [web:391][web:13]

### Border Returns Versus Interior Removals

Analysts distinguish between “border” removals, usually involving people apprehended soon after entry, and “interior” removals, which involve people arrested after living in the United States for some time. [web:385][web:13] Historical data show that Clinton and Bush presided over very high numbers of border returns, while Obama’s early years and some more recent periods saw relatively more interior removals; under Trump’s second term the balance has again shifted toward the interior, with profound implications for families, workplaces, and local institutions. [web:28][web:391][web:289]

| Administration | Approximate total removals* | Distinctive feature |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clinton | Roughly 12 million (two terms, dominated by border returns). [web:28][web:382] | Built up post‑IIRIRA removal machinery; border‑focused. |
| George W. Bush | Roughly 10 million, mostly border returns. [web:28][web:382] | Post‑9/11 securitization; creation of ICE/CBP. |
| Obama | About 2.7–3 million formal removals, record annual averages. [web:382][web:390] | High interior removals; “deporter in chief” debate. |
| Trump I | Roughly 1.5–2 million removals over one term. [web:28][web:382] | Fewer removals than predecessors but harsher rhetoric. |
| Biden | Around 1.4+ million removals through FY 2024, plus many Title 42 expulsions. [web:9][web:382] | Heavy use of border returns and expulsions. |
| Trump II (early) | Rising removals, with a higher interior share than recent years. [web:391][web:289] | Emphasis on interior enforcement and visibility. |

\*Figures combine formal removals and certain returns, and vary by data source; they are presented here to illustrate relative scale and approach, not as exact counts.

### The Problem of Self‑Deportation and Survey Estimates

Some large figures cited for “departures” rely on surveys asking people whether they have left, plan to leave, or feel less safe, then extrapolate to millions of people assumed to have self‑deported. [web:11][web:382] Social scientists caution that such methods cannot reliably distinguish between actual departures, decisions not to migrate, status adjustments, or simple changes in survey response behavior, and that confidence intervals and response biases make precise claims about self‑deportation highly uncertain. [web:375][web:6]

### Why Accurate Numbers Matter

Understanding the scale and composition of removals is not just an academic exercise; it determines which communities brace for disruption, which school districts prepare for sudden absences, and how both U.S. and Mexican authorities plan for reception and reintegration. [web:13][web:420][web:273] When numbers are inflated, misused, or poorly explained, public debate becomes driven by fear and political theater rather than by realistic assessments of capacity, cost, and human impact. [web:11][web:391] For deportees and their families, the difference between a rhetoric of “millions removed” and the more complex reality can mean the difference between panic and informed preparation.

# PART FOUR: FAMILY DISSOLUTION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA

## Chapter 5: The Children of Deportation—When Americans Lose Parents

### The Scale: Millions of Children at Risk

Analysts estimate that more than 5 million U.S. citizen children live in mixed‑status households where at least one parent lacks lawful immigration status, and many millions more children are close relatives of people at risk of detention o5 depotation.


---### When Detention Becomes the Family’s Center of Gravity

For many families, once a parent is detained, the entire household’s schedule, finances, and emotional energy begin to revolve around that facility. [web:410][web:405] Caregivers must juggle work, childcare, school meetings, and long trips to detention centers, all while trying to keep children informed enough to feel safe but not so overwhelmed that they shut down. [web:406][web:415] Phone calls to detention are often expensive and brief, and children may feel pressure to stay positive on the line even when they are scared or angry, which can make it harder for them to process what is happening. [web:410][web:452]

### The Invisible Work of Caregivers

The parent or relative who remains in the United States often has to become breadwinner, emotional anchor, and legal advocate all at once. [web:405][web:413] Studies describe caregivers taking on multiple jobs, navigating complex court processes in a second language, and managing children’s behavioral changes with little formal support, leading to high levels of burnout and depression among adults as well as children. [web:406][web:417] In mixed‑status families, caregivers may also fear interacting with schools, hospitals, and public agencies, which reduces access to the very services that could help children cope. [web:420][web:458]

### What Children Say They Need

When researchers and clinicians ask directly, children affected by detention and deportation consistently say they want clear information, reassurance that they are not to blame, and spaces where they can talk about what is happening without being judged. [web:452][web:406] Many also ask for practical help—transportation to visit parents, counseling in schools, and adults who understand the immigration system well enough to answer basic questions honestly. [web:417][web:420] These requests point toward interventions that are feasible but not yet widely available: trauma‑informed school supports, low‑cost mental‑health care, and community organizations equipped to walk families through the long aftermath of an enforcement action. [web:413][web:64]

# PART FIVE: THE ECONOMIC ROLE OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS

## Chapter 6: The Economic Role of Undocumented Workers

### Why Economics Belongs in a Human Report

Any honest account of deportation has to talk about people’s lives, families, and mental health, but it also has to talk about money. [web:13][web:418] Decisions about how aggressively to enforce immigration law are often justified as economic choices—protecting jobs, wages, or public budgets—so it matters what the numbers actually say. [web:421][web:424] Ignoring the economic dimension leaves the field open to slogans; engaging it carefully shows how closely human dignity and economic reality are tied together.

### How Many Undocumented Workers Are in the Labor Force

Best‑available estimates suggest that several million undocumented immigrants are currently working in the United States, with labor‑force participation rates that are often higher than those of native‑born workers. [web:375][web:414] Because many undocumented people are of prime working age and concentrated in sectors with persistent labor demand, their removal would leave substantial gaps that cannot easily be filled overnight. [web:13][web:418] Even when automation and recruitment of other workers offset some losses over time, the short‑term disruption can be severe for employers, consumers, and local economies.

### Where Undocumented Workers Are Concentrated

Undocumented workers are not spread evenly across the economy; they are clustered in particular industries and occupations. [web:414][web:418] In agriculture and food processing, they plant, harvest, butcher, and package much of the food that ends up on U.S. tables; in construction, they pour concrete, frame houses, and handle roofing and finishing work; in hospitality, they clean hotel rooms, wash dishes, and prep food behind the scenes. [web:414][web:418][web:421] In many of these roles, employers report chronic difficulty recruiting enough authorized workers willing to accept the wages, hours, and conditions on offer.

### Taxes Paid by Undocumented Immigrants

Despite lacking lawful status, undocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars each year in federal, state, and local taxes through payroll withholding, income‑tax filings (often with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers), property taxes (directly or through rent), and sales taxes. [web:424][web:457] Recent analyses estimate that undocumented immigrants contributed on the order of $30–40 billion annually in state and local taxes nationwide, and close to $100 billion in total federal, state, and local taxes combined. [web:424][web:466][web:462] In several states, undocumented residents’ tax payments exceed what the state spends on services for them, challenging the narrative that they are primarily “takers” from public systems. [web:465][web:459]

### Economic Ripple Effects of Mass Removals

When a significant share of the undocumented workforce is removed or driven into deeper precarity, the immediate effects include lost earnings, business disruption, and reduced consumer spending in neighborhoods where those workers live. [web:13][web:418] Over time, macro‑level models suggest that large‑scale deportations would modestly shrink national GDP, reduce overall employment (because immigrant labor and native‑born jobs are linked), and put upward pressure on prices in sectors like food and housing. [web:13][web:421] These projections vary by model and assumption, but most agree that mass removal is economically costly and that any gains for specific groups of workers are accompanied by broader losses.

### Why This Matters for Policy and Public Opinion

Economic arguments are often used to justify harsh enforcement—claims that undocumented immigrants “steal jobs,” “drive down wages,” or “drain public coffers.” [web:13][web:421] The evidence paints a more complicated picture: undocumented workers are essential to certain industries, contribute significantly in taxes, and have limited effects on native‑born workers’ wages overall, while aggressive removals can damage local economies and public finances. [web:418][web:424][web:457] Recognizing this does not erase the need for immigration law, but it undercuts narratives that depict undocumented people only as burdens and helps explain why both U.S. and Mexican economies are entangled in any serious conversation about deportation.

# PART SIX: THE POST-DEPORTATION CRISIS

## Chapter 7: Life After Deportation—What Really Happens

### The Logistics of Removal

The official act of removal—an entry in a database, a tally in a chart—represents only a fraction of what deportation means in real life. [web:261][web:413] In practice, deportees often endure weeks or months in detention, multiple transfers between facilities, and long waits for flights or bus convoys that will take them to Mexico, frequently shackled and with limited access to their belongings. [web:2][web:405] For families, that entire period is experienced as a drawn‑out crisis, not a single event.

### First Hours on the Other Side

Once in Mexico, deportees may find themselves at an official repatriation point—such as Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, Nogales, or Reynosa—or at smaller crossings used for particular flights or bus routes. [web:427][web:430] Mexican authorities and partner organizations may be present to register arrivals, offer water and food, and direct people toward “México te abraza” reception centers or shelters, but coverage is uneven and capacity varies by day and location. [web:205][web:435] Some deportees report being released with only a small amount of cash and no clear guidance on how to reach their home community or secure safe lodging for the night. [web:218][web:439][web:434]

### México te Abraza: Promise and Shortfalls

The “México te abraza” strategy is designed to centralize reception and provide a package of services: temporary shelter, meals, basic medical care, documentation help (such as CURP and identification), and transportation to states of origin. [web:205][web:428] Government statements emphasize the creation of multiple centers along the border and in strategic interior locations, along with coordination with state authorities and social programs meant to integrate returnees into health, education, and employment systems. [web:427][web:437] However, independent reports indicate that many deportees either do not reach these centers, leave quickly, or do not experience them as a meaningful bridge to long‑term stability. [web:218][web:431][web:440]

### On the Streets and in Shelters

In border cities with heavy deportation flows, shelters operated by churches, NGOs, and mutual‑aid groups have long played a central role in receiving deportees, often with minimal funding. [web:434][web:439] These shelters offer beds, meals, basic health care, and sometimes legal or psychological support, but they can become overcrowded, especially when deportations surge or other migration flows converge on the same locations. [web:436][web:442] Deportees who cannot access shelters may end up sleeping in plazas, encampments, or cheap hotels where they are more exposed to extortion, robbery, and recruitment by criminal groups. [web:439][web:441]

### Returning to Interior States

Those who manage to travel on to states such as Guanajuato enter communities with varying levels of formal support. [web:273][web:295] Some state governments have programs to assist return migrants with documentation, schooling for children, and small business development, while others offer only limited services or rely heavily on federal initiatives whose funding may be unstable. [web:422][web:425] Deportees frequently report difficulty translating U.S. work experience into Mexican credentials, confronting employers who see them as risky hires or assume they will soon attempt to leave again. [web:431][web:422]

### Emotional and Spiritual Aftermath

The emotional landscape after deportation is shaped by grief, shame, relief at surviving, anger at perceived injustice, and anxiety about the future—all often existing at once. [web:405][web:413] Men and women who were heads of household in the United States describe feeling that they have failed their families, while also recognizing that the system was stacked against them; many turn to faith communities or informal peer networks for support in the absence of formal counseling. [web:408][web:436] For deportees who land in places like Guanajuato and encounter local residents willing to listen and help, that human welcome can make the difference between spiraling into despair and beginning to rebuild.

# PART SEVEN: THE DACA CRISIS—WHEN LEGAL STATUS HOLDERS FACE DEPORTATION

## Chapter 8: DACA at a Crossroads

### A Decade of Conditional Security

Since 2012, DACA has allowed hundreds of thousands of young people who were brought to the United States as children to live and work with a measure of protection, but always under the shadow of renewal deadlines and political battles. [web:294][web:347] Recipients have used this window to complete degrees, enter professions, buy homes, and start families, yet their underlying status remains “deferred action”—a promise not to deport that can, in principle, be withdrawn. [web:294][web:234] The last several years of litigation and shifting guidance have underscored how fragile that promise is.

### 2025 Legal Landscape

In 2025, federal court decisions have declared aspects of DACA unlawful while leaving in place injunctions that prevent the government from summarily ending protections for current recipients. [web:232][web:234] The result is a patchwork regime: people who already have DACA can continue to renew it, but new applicants are effectively barred from entering the program even if they meet all the criteria. [web:294][web:429] Legal advocates emphasize that this limbo status puts recipients under constant stress and makes it difficult for employers, universities, and families to plan for the long term. [web:232][web:433]

### Economic and Social Stakes

DACA recipients contribute billions of dollars in wages and taxes each year and are deeply embedded in key sectors such as education, health care, and technology. [web:294][web:347] Many teach in bilingual classrooms, work as nurses or medical aides, or fill hard‑to‑staff roles in rural communities, making their potential loss not just a personal tragedy but a blow to local service capacity. [web:347][web:418] Surveys consistently show high levels of civic engagement among DACA recipients, including volunteering, advocacy, and community leadership, undercutting narratives that portray them as passive beneficiaries. [web:275][web:417]

---

# PART EIGHT: THE BIFURCATED CRISIS—UNDERSTANDING THE DUAL THREAT

## Chapter 9: Dreamers as Transnational People

### 9.1 Growing Up in the In‑Between

Most DACA recipients and other “Dreamers” arrived in the United States as children or adolescents and did the work of growing up—learning to read, making friends, figuring out who they are—in American schools and neighborhoods. [web:294][web:347] They pledge allegiance in classrooms, play on local sports teams, attend youth groups and quinceañeras, consume U.S. media, and internalize American cultural references, even as they also absorb the language, food, and traditions of their families’ countries of origin. [web:558][web:563] The result is a generation that is deeply bicultural, but whose legal paperwork recognizes only the country they left, not the country that shaped them.

Scholars sometimes call this group the “1.5 generation”: neither first‑generation immigrants who arrived as adults nor second‑generation children of immigrants born in the United States, but somewhere between. [web:567] Research on this population shows that they often feel pressure to “perform” different versions of themselves in different settings—more American at school, more Mexican or Central American at home—which can be a source of both resilience and stress. [web:556][web:561] When law and policy treat them exclusively as foreigners, that experience of being in‑between turns from a cultural fact into a legal and psychological wound.

### 9.2 Bicultural Identity: Strength and Strain

Work on bicultural identity integration suggests that people who are able to see their two cultural identities as compatible and overlapping tend to report better mental‑health outcomes than those who experience them as constantly in conflict. [web:568][web:565] Many Dreamers describe precisely this kind of integration: they are comfortable switching between English and Spanish, between different conversational styles with elders and peers, and they see their mixed identity as a source of creativity and empathy. [web:561][web:571] They can explain U.S. life to relatives in Mexico and Mexican family traditions to American friends, acting as cultural translators in both directions.

But the same research also finds that structural exclusion—being told by institutions or laws that one does not belong—can undermine that sense of harmony and push identities into tension. [web:552][web:560] For DACA recipients, the message from daily life (“you are part of us, we rely on you”) collides with the message from the immigration system (“you can stay for now, but you may have to leave”). [web:552][web:579] Over time, this mismatch can erode trust, produce feelings of alienation, and make it harder to maintain a positive sense of self even when people are outwardly successful in school or work. [web:545][web:578]

### 9.3 Belonging, Rejection, and the Politics of Being Told “Go Home”

Qualitative studies with DACA recipients in states like California and North Carolina find that political attacks on the program and on immigrants more broadly have tangible effects on people’s sense of belonging. [web:560][web:556] Participants describe feeling increasingly unwanted and unsafe after high‑profile efforts to rescind DACA or restrict other forms of relief, even when their immediate daily routines did not change. [web:575][web:578] Many postpone major life decisions—buying homes, investing in advanced degrees, starting families—because they cannot trust that the country that raised them will still claim them in a few years. [web:542][web:573]

The language used in public debate matters. When political leaders speak of “sending them back,” Dreamers hear a directive to leave the only home they truly know, often to countries where they may be linguistically and culturally marked as outsiders. [web:576][web:570] Some adopt a defiant stance, embracing labels like “undocumented and unafraid” and building activist identities that draw strength from community organizing. [web:574][web:562] Others turn inward, limiting their movements, avoiding public spaces, and living with chronic fear that any interaction with police or authorities could trigger a chain of events leading to deportation. [web:572][web:578]

### 9.4 Mental Health in the Shadow of Uncertainty

Empirical work on DACA and mental health finds that the program initially produced measurable improvements in well‑being—reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety by lowering the immediate threat of deportation and opening up opportunities in education and employment. [web:557][web:566] However, subsequent attempts to end or restrict DACA reversed many of those gains; surveys after rescission announcements show spikes in sadness, hopelessness, and clinical levels of distress among recipients. [web:575][web:578] One study found that DACA recipients were significantly more likely than both documented immigrants and non‑DACA undocumented peers to report high distress linked specifically to the threat of losing protections they had briefly enjoyed. [web:578][web:572]

Dreamers also face practical barriers to accessing mental‑health care, including cost, lack of insurance, stigma, and mistrust of institutions that they fear might share information with authorities. [web:566][web:583] Many rely instead on informal coping mechanisms: faith communities, peer support groups, campus resource centers, and online networks where they can speak openly about status and identity. [web:556][web:569] These supports are powerful, but they were never designed to carry the full weight of a national policy choice; expecting informal networks to absorb the psychological fallout of legal insecurity is itself a quiet form of policy failure.

### 9.5 Imagining “Home” in Mexico from Afar

For Dreamers of Mexican origin, Mexico exists as both an intimate presence—through parents, food, holidays, and trips stories—and a distant abstraction, especially for those who have never visited or only did so as children. [web:563][web:564] Some describe a romanticized attachment—“soy de aquí y soy de allá,” “I’m from here and from there”—while also acknowledging that their understanding of Mexico is filtered through family narratives and occasional visits, not through the daily grind of living and working there. [web:564][web:581] Research on DACA recipients who traveled to Mexico under advance parole found that many experienced a complicated mixture of recognition and estrangement: welcomed by relatives, but marked by accent, clothing, or mannerisms as “the one from the other side.” [web:564]

This matters for deportation because it reveals how limited the idea of “going back” really is. For many Dreamers, there is no seamless “return” to a life that existed before migration; there is only arrival in a place that is partly familiar and partly foreign, where they may be seen as privileged outsiders or as people who abandoned their roots. [web:564][web:552] The risk is that deportation will not simply restore a disrupted identity; it may deepen the sense of not fully belonging anywhere.

### 9.6 What Deportation Would Mean for Identity

If DACA were dismantled and large numbers of Dreamers were deported, the consequences would not be limited to job loss or school disruption. [web:570][web:572] People who have spent most of their lives asserting and negotiating an American identity would be forcibly recast as deportees in Mexico, where that American identity may be both a resource (English, education, global perspective) and a stigma (associated with wealth, arrogance, or foreignness). [web:564][web:571] In interviews with returnees, some describe finding unexpected pride in their Mexican identity over time, while others report enduring feelings of dislocation and ongoing efforts to “prove” their belonging in both countries. [web:564][web:582]

For second‑generation U.S. citizen children of Dreamers, parental deportation would add another layer of identity complexity: they may grow up with passports and birthright citizenship in a country they no longer live in, while navigating schools and social expectations in Mexico where they are seen as extranjeros. [web:420][web:408] Their sense of who they are will be shaped not only by family and peers but by the way both states treat their parents—as valued contributors or as disposable bodies. A policy that uproots Dreamers is, in this sense, also a policy about what kind of people their children are allowed to become.

### 9.7 Why Identity Work Belongs in a Policy Report

It might be tempting to treat identity as a soft topic compared to budgets, detention capacity, or removal statistics, but for Dreamers it is central to understanding what policy choices actually do. [web:552][web:560] Laws that say “you are only temporarily tolerated here” do not just regulate movement; they shape how people answer the question “who am I?” and “who is my community?” The research record is clear that prolonged legal precarity and experiences of exclusion can erode mental health, reduce educational attainment, and make it harder for people to invest in long‑term goals. [web:557][web:566][web:578]

From the perspective of projects like The Mexico Deportee Coalition, this means that supporting Dreamers cannot stop at helping with paperwork or job searches if deportations increase. It will also require spaces—support groups, mentorship programs, storytelling platforms, and cross‑border communities—where people can reconstruct identities that honor both where they came from and what they have lived through. [web:574][web:582] The “Deportee Directory” and a future podcast featuring deportees and Dreamers are not just media projects; they are tools for collective identity work, a way to insist that these lives are more than case numbers in any government database.

# PART NINE: THE RESISTANCE AND SOLUTIONS

## Chapter 10: If Dreamers Are Deported

### 10.1 From Legal Limbo to Forced Departure

For more than a decade, DACA has functioned as a narrow bridge over a legal void, allowing recipients to work, study, and raise families while never granting a secure immigration status. [web:294][web:552] If courts or policymakers dismantle that bridge without replacing it, a significant number of Dreamers could face direct deportation or feel compelled to “self‑deport” under pressure—leaving not by choice but because they see no viable future in the United States. [web:232][web:634] In either case, the outcome is the same: people who have built entire adult lives in the U.S. find themselves cast out into a country that, for many, exists more in family stories than in lived experience. [web:552][web:617]

The risk is not hypothetical. Cases already exist of DACA recipients who traveled on advance parole, were caught in technicalities or old removal orders, and were summarily sent to Mexico despite having authorization to re‑enter. [web:626][web:637] Their accounts—of suddenly realizing, at an airport or border crossing, that they might not be allowed back to their homes, jobs, and families—foreshadow what a larger wave of Dreamer deportations would feel like on the ground. [web:626][web:617]

### 10.2 Professional and Educational Roadblocks in Mexico

Dreamers who arrive in Mexico after years of schooling and work in the United States bring human capital that should, in theory, be valuable: degrees, licenses, bilingual skills, and professional networks. [web:294][web:544] In practice, their path is blocked by complex and often slow processes for recognizing foreign credentials. Mexico requires “revalidación” of foreign studies and degrees through the Ministry of Education and related bodies, a procedure that involves gathering official diplomas, transcripts, and sometimes detailed course syllabi, then waiting months for review. [web:629][web:644] For certain professions—like medicine—specialized councils and universities must also certify that curricula are equivalent, a process that can take close to a year and may demand additional coursework or exams. [web:635][web:632]

For a Dreamer who has been working as a nurse, engineer, or teacher in the United States, this can mean an abrupt fall from stable professional identity into underemployment: call‑center work, informal tutoring, low‑wage service jobs, or periods of unemployment while paperwork crawls through the system. [web:618][web:628] Some may eventually manage to align their credentials with Mexican requirements and re‑enter their fields, but the delay has real costs—lost income, drained savings, and erosion of skills that were honed in U.S. workplaces. [web:618][web:632]

### 10.3 Reintegration as a Long, Uneven Process

Research on return and deported migrants in cities like León and Mexico City shows that reintegration is not a single moment but a multi‑year process shaped by social networks, savings, and local labor markets. [web:618][web:619] Deportees often start at a disadvantage compared with voluntary returnees: they arrive with fewer resources, less control over timing, and more acute emotional distress. [web:619][web:622] Over time, some manage to leverage their skills and transnational ties to rebuild livelihoods, but many report long stretches of precarious work, housing insecurity, and ongoing feelings of disempowerment. [web:618][web:639]

Dreamers fit awkwardly into this picture. They may speak Spanish with an accent, lack Mexican work histories, and have limited familiarity with how institutions function, from banking to public health systems. [web:563][web:552] Studies on “de facto deportation” and adolescent returnees in Mexican states such as Oaxaca highlight high levels of helplessness, anger, and mental‑health symptoms among young people who feel they have been pushed out of the United States and dropped into an environment they did not choose. [web:642][web:619] For DACA recipients in their twenties and thirties, the same dynamics apply, but with the added weight of responsibility for children and older relatives.

### 10.4 Mental Health After Forced Return

The mental‑health consequences of deportation are well‑documented: elevated rates of depression, anxiety, and poor sleep among deportees compared with both non‑migrants and voluntary returnees. [web:633][web:636] A qualitative study of Mexicans returned from the United States found that those who were deported or forced to return reported more intense emotional distress than those who chose to go back, often describing feelings of shame, loss of control, and bitterness about the conditions that pushed them out. [web:619] Another project focusing on returned migrants in Mexico City identified higher levels of depressive symptoms and psychological distress among those who left children behind, especially when social support was weak. [web:630]

For Dreamers, the psychological stakes are even higher because deportation strikes at the core of their identity. [web:617][web:552] Clinicians who work with this population note that many have spent years coping with chronic legal uncertainty, discrimination, and fear of family separation; being deported after such a prolonged struggle can trigger not only acute trauma responses but also a sense of narrative collapse—“everything I did to play by the rules still ended in exile.” [web:617][web:575] Without targeted, culturally attuned mental‑health services in Mexico, there is a serious risk that large‑scale Dreamer deportations would produce a shadow mental‑health crisis among a group that, on paper, appears highly “successful.” [web:639][web:646]

### 10.5 Families, Children, and Transnational Fallout

Many DACA recipients are now parents of U.S. citizen children or caregivers in extended families with mixed statuses. [web:557][web:420] If they are deported, families face wrenching choices: split households and leave children in the United States with the other parent or relatives, or relocate together to Mexico where children must adapt to new schools, languages, and social norms. [web:643][web:408] Existing research on U.S. citizen minors living in Mexico shows that children who move south after a parent’s deportation or forced return can struggle with placement in the Mexican school system, documentation gaps, and discrimination, all of which compound the emotional impact of the move. [web:643][web:639]

At the community level, enforced return on a large scale may have broader effects. One study tracing the “long shadow” of U.S. immigration enforcement on violence found that municipalities in Mexico receiving higher numbers of deportees saw increases in homicide rates and criminal‑organization presence, suggesting that mass return can strain local systems and create openings for crime. [web:620] If Dreamers are pushed into the same under‑resourced settings as other deportees, their skills and aspirations may be undercut by surroundings marked by insecurity, limited public services, and few paths to meaningful work—conditions that hurt not just them, but also their families and neighbors. [web:628][web:640]

### 10.6 What Could Be Different: Planning for Dreamer Reintegration Now

If governments and civil society insist on treating Dreamer deportation as impossible or purely hypothetical, they will be unprepared if it happens. [web:628][web:631] A more responsible approach would acknowledge the risk and start building specific reintegration pathways now, even while fighting for permanent protections in the United States. That could include:

- **Dedicated credential‑recognition tracks** for returnees educated in U.S. schools and universities, with streamlined processes, clear timelines, and reduced fees. [web:629][web:644]  
- **Targeted job‑matching and entrepreneurship programs** that connect Dreamers’ skills—language, technology, teaching, health care—with real opportunities in Mexican labor markets, rather than defaulting to low‑wage, low‑skill placements. [web:618][web:641]  
- **Binational mental‑health initiatives** that train providers on the specific experiences of deported Dreamers and offer low‑cost counseling, peer support groups, and crisis hotlines in high‑return regions. [web:639][web:646]

These are not luxuries; they are the minimum needed to avoid wasting the education and experience that Dreamers have accumulated, largely in U.S. institutions. [web:623][web:544] For organizations like The Mexico Deportee Coalition, the task is not only to respond once people arrive, but to push for these structural changes, document where systems fail, and build parallel supports—a Deportee Directory, mentorship networks, and story‑driven media—so that if the worst‑case scenario unfolds, Dreamers are not left to navigate the aftermath in isolation. [web:628][web:618]

# PART TEN: SYNTHESIS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND THE PATH FORWARD

## Chapter 11: What This Moment Demands

### 11.1 Naming the Dual Crisis

Across this report, two realities keep colliding: a U.S. system moving toward mass detention and deportation as a primary policy tool, and a Mexican system asked to absorb the human fallout with limited resources and fragile local conditions. [web:11][web:422] Plans and agendas associated with Project 2025 and similar efforts explicitly envision greatly expanded use of expedited removals, detention capacity, and executive power over immigration, while narrowing humanitarian protections and legal avenues. [web:172][web:657][web:658] On the other side of the border, strategies like “México te abraza” offer important but modest supports—shelter, transport, small cash transfers—within broader budgets that are tightening and institutions already stretched by other migration flows. [web:499][web:422][web:504]

This is the bifurcated crisis: not just more removals from the United States, and not just more pressure on Mexican shelters and reception centers, but the combination of both at scale. [web:628][web:640] It is a crisis that runs through detention centers, schoolyards, remittance‑dependent towns, border shelters, and the lives of Dreamers whose identities and skills do not fit any simple category of “returnee.” [web:24][web:552][web:618]

### 11.2 What Mass Deportation Would Actually Do

Economic and policy modeling makes clear that mass deportation on the scale proposed in recent blueprints would be costly and destabilizing, not just for undocumented people but for citizens and lawful residents. [web:672][web:661] National and state‑level analyses project reductions in GDP, job losses for U.S.‑born workers, and billions in lost federal, state, and local tax revenue if large shares of the undocumented workforce were removed, particularly in agriculture, construction, hospitality, and care work. [web:103][web:664][web:686] One study focusing on California estimates that mass deportations would cut hundreds of billions from that state’s economy alone and “decimate” key sectors; similar reports for New York, Minnesota, and other states reach parallel conclusions. [web:695][web:667][web:670]

At the same time, research on social and public‑health impacts shows that aggressive enforcement increases family separation, community stress, and adverse health outcomes, especially for children and mixed‑status households. [web:24][web:4][web:684] Expanded removal powers and detention capacity do not simply produce “order”; they export trauma to Mexico, where receiving communities must confront the combined consequences of U.S. policy and their own structural inequalities. [web:628][web:639][web:691]

### 11.3 A Different Set of Policy Choices

There is nothing inevitable about the path toward mass deportation. Policy briefs and research‑based proposals offer a different direction that would prioritize safety, fairness, and long‑term stability:

- **Refocus enforcement on genuine public‑safety threats** by tailoring priorities to people who pose serious risks, rather than sweeping in parents, long‑term workers, and Dreamers who have grown up in the United States. [web:602][web:676]  
- **Create durable status for long‑settled residents**, including DACA recipients and other mixed‑status families, through legislation that provides a path to citizenship and removes the constant threat of removal from people who are already woven into U.S. communities. [web:552][web:544][web:694]  
- **Guarantee access to legal representation and due process** in immigration proceedings so that life‑altering decisions are not made in assembly‑line hearings where most people lack attorneys. [web:11][web:676]  

On the Mexican side, a forward‑looking response would mean converting emergency reception efforts into a long‑term reintegration policy: systematic funding for credential recognition, targeted employment programs, mental‑health services, and safety strategies in high‑return municipalities. [web:422][web:628][web:639] The goal would be to ensure that deportees and returnees are seen not just as a welfare burden, but as potential contributors whose skills and experience can strengthen local economies and civic life. [web:618][web:691]

### 11.4 The Role for Civil Society and Cross‑Border Infrastructure

Even under better laws, there will always be people caught in the gears of enforcement and return. That is why civil‑society infrastructure—on both sides of the border—is as important as statutory reform. Rapid response networks, legal defense funds, and campus and community “safe” policies in the United States help people survive enforcement actions with some measure of dignity and support. [web:485][web:489][web:662] Mexican shelters, human‑rights organizations, and local collectives provide first‑line care and accompaniment for deportees and migrants who arrive with few resources and significant trauma. [web:504][web:506][web:498]

The missing piece is a durable cross‑border backbone that connects these efforts: a way for legal teams in the U.S. to coordinate with reception centers in Mexico, for deportees to find each other and trusted services quickly, and for Dreamers forced to return to access specialized guidance on education, licensing, and mental health. [web:628][web:618] This is the space The Mexico Deportee Coalition aims to inhabit—not as a replacement for existing organizations, but as connective tissue that amplifies them, fills gaps, and keeps deportees themselves at the center of the story.

### 11.5 What This Report Asks of the Reader

This report cannot stop a single deportation on its own, but it can help clarify what is at stake and what kinds of action matter. For lawmakers and policymakers, the request is straightforward: treat mass deportation not as an abstract talking point but as a policy with measurable economic, social, and human costs on both sides of the border, and legislate accordingly. [web:11][web:672][web:694] For funders and institutions, the invitation is to invest in the less visible infrastructure of legal defense, mental‑health care, and reintegration in Mexico, not only in high‑profile border operations. [web:103][web:686][web:498]

For communities, deportees, and Dreamers themselves, the call is to keep building the networks of solidarity that have always been the real counterweight to humiliation and isolation: rapid response teams, mutual‑aid projects, shelters, study groups, advocacy campaigns, and, now, coalitions like TMDC that explicitly link life in the United States to life after deportation in Mexico. [web:485][web:498][web:606] The choices made in the next few years will determine whether mass deportation remains a looming threat or becomes a lived reality for millions. This report is one contribution to making those choices as honest, informed, and humane as possible.

## Toward Solutions: From Crisis to Coalition

The chapters so far have traced how policy decisions in Washington and Mexico City reverberate through detention centers, living rooms, schoolyards, and job sites on both sides of the border. The question that follows is what can be done—not only by governments, but by communities, organizations, and individuals who refuse to accept humiliation and isolation as the last word for deportees and Dreamers. [web:2][web:392][web:205] The remaining sections of this report explore existing forms of resistance, outline practical steps toward a more humane system, and sketch the role that a cross‑border initiative like The Mexico Deportee Coalition—and projects such as a “Deportee Directory” and story‑driven podcast—might play in that larger ecosystem.
