### A Note from the Author

My name is Paul Green. I grew up a country boy in North Carolina, in a family where faith, hard work, and showing up for people in hard times were not ideas but habits. In 2017, I packed up my life in the United States and came to Mexico, landing in Guanajuato for what I thought would be a temporary adventure. Somewhere between watching the sun set over the tunnels, getting lost in the alleys, and being welcomed into ordinary daily rhythms, that “temporary adventure” quietly became home. [web:273]

Since late 2020 and early 2021, I have run a small, low‑cost business helping people relocate to Mexico and helping those already here make sense of visas, neighborhoods, and everyday realities. Over these years I have talked with countless would‑be movers and new arrivals. Watching them build full, joyful lives in Guanajuato and beyond has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life; it means being a tiny part of someone else’s success story, not just my own. The service is simple in design but deep in content: hard‑earned knowledge, personal experience, and years of building networks and asking questions about what it really takes to move to Mexico and thrive. [web:273]

Unlike high‑priced facilitators who charge hundreds of dollars to answer basic questions, I have tried to keep my support accessible and grounded in real life. Much of what I share is about culture and history, local events, and the small details of daily life that make Guanajuato feel like home rather than a beautiful backdrop. I manage a Facebook community (“Guanajuato Expats, Guanajuatenses, and Visitors”) and a Skool community called “Wonderful Guanajuato,” where I write guides and essays about this city that has given me so much joy, wonder, and apapacho. [web:273]

Alongside all of that, another reality has become impossible to ignore: deportees returning to Mexico from the United States, often with U.S. citizen children, broken families, and no clear next step. They are in border shelters and small interior towns, on buses and in factories, in call centers and in informal jobs. Many are scared, disoriented, and grieving. Too often, they are invisible or reduced to a statistic. [web:218][web:273]

The Mexico Deportee Coalition is my attempt to respond to that reality with the tools I have: words, relationships, and stubborn hope. I am a conservative, southern, Christian, white man from the United States who now calls Mexico home; part of what moves me is knowing that not all Americans believe deportees are unwelcome, disposable, or beyond redemption. Deportees deserve dignity, opportunity, and a real chance to rebuild. Getting deported is often catastrophic in the short term, but for those who are ambitious and willing to adapt, it does not have to be the end of their story. In some cases, it can become another kind of cross‑border success story, not so different from the voluntary moves I have helped people make for years. [web:273]

For years I have helped people—with options, passports, and resources—move to Mexico by choice and build good lives here. The deportees this report is about rarely had the luxury of choice, planning, or a soft landing. My hope is that, over time, this coalition can help change that: a cross‑border, cross‑culture effort, a deportee support network that is actually connected—the “Deportee Directory”—and eventually a podcast where deportees and their families can speak for themselves about what happens when a life is ripped out from under them, and how they build again. [web:205][web:218]

I expect to be just one of many members in this coalition, not its center. My role is to help remind deportees that they are not alone, that there are people they have never met who carry real sympathy and real hope for them. Not all Americans believe they are unwanted—even people from the South like me. This report is one way of saying exactly that.

With gratitude to Guanajuato, to every deportee who has trusted me with their story, and to anyone willing to read this with an open mind,

## FRONT MATTER

### About The Mexico Deportee Coalition

The Mexico Deportee Coalition (TMDC) is a nonpartisan organization dedicated to documenting the reality of deportations, supporting communities affected by enforcement, and advancing policy solutions grounded in evidence rather than politics. Operating at the intersection of the United States and Mexico, TMDC seeks to understand what actually happens when the U.S. deports people—not what politicians claim happens, but what evidence shows. [web:273][web:263]

**Our Mission**: To generate rigorous, independent research on deportation policies and their impacts; to amplify the voices and experiences of affected communities; and to advocate for policies that prioritize human dignity, family unity, and evidence‑based solutions. [web:273]

**Our Values**:  
- **Truth above politics**: Report what data show, regardless of which administration initiated policies. [web:293]  
- **Evidence first**: Ground every major claim in verifiable data, academic research, or documented government records. [web:263][web:346]  
- **Human dignity**: Center the voices and humanity of those affected by deportation. [web:4][web:218]  
- **Accountability**: Document abuses, costs, and failures without regard to political affiliation. [web:11][web:271]  
- **Solutions focus**: Identify what works and what could work better, in both the United States and Mexico. [web:273][web:205]

**Our Commitment**: This report strives to meet high standards of academic and journalistic rigor for a small, emerging initiative. Sources are cited transparently, limitations and uncertainties are acknowledged, and critique and additional evidence are welcomed. [web:293]

### How to Read This Report

**What This Report Is**:  
- A comprehensive, evidence‑based analysis of Trump‑era deportation policies in the second administration (2025–present) and their impacts across multiple dimensions. [web:14][web:9][web:11]  
- An integrated examination of both undocumented immigrant removals and the unfolding crisis facing DACA recipients and other long‑term residents with precarious legal status. [web:232][web:292][web:294]  
- A synthesis of U.S. and Mexican government data, peer‑reviewed research, organizational reports, and ground‑level observations in Mexican communities receiving deportees. [web:263][web:273][web:261][web:205]  
- A nonpartisan factual document designed to inform policy decisions, public understanding, and early‑stage philanthropic and community responses. [web:293]  
- A resource for policymakers, researchers, advocates, deportees, families, faith communities, and donors seeking to respond in concrete, constructive ways.

**What This Report Is NOT**:  
- A partisan attack on any administration or a defense of any political party. [web:293]  
- A prediction of exact future deportation totals, which depend on policy, budgets, court rulings, and broader economic conditions. [web:341]  
- A comprehensive legal guide or substitute for individualized legal counsel.  
- A replacement for the testimony and leadership of deportees themselves; rather, it is intended to clear space and provide context for those voices.

**How Sources Are Used**:  
- Major claims are backed by at least one credible source, such as U.S. agency data, Mexican government statistics, peer‑reviewed studies, or recognized advocacy and research organizations. [web:263][web:346][web:261][web:273]  
- Where official figures and independent estimates diverge—for example around the true number of removals, the composition of the detained population, or the capacity of Mexico’s “México te abraza” program—the report presents both and explains likely reasons for the gap (definitions, timeframes, methodology, or politics). [web:14][web:9][web:205][web:218][web:298]  
- When evidence is incomplete or contested, findings are framed cautiously, and the uncertainty is highlighted so readers understand where the ground is firm and where it is still shifting.

**Data Currency**: The analysis reflects information available through December 2025, including ICE and CBP data releases analyzed by journalists and researchers, updated DACA status explainers, and recent assessments of Mexico’s reception and reintegration strategies. [web:9][web:14][web:232][web:292][web:273][web:218]

### Evidence and Neutrality

This report takes positions on facts, not parties. Wherever possible, it compares deportation, detention, and DACA trends across multiple administrations using the best available figures from official U.S. and Mexican sources, independent monitoring projects, and peer‑reviewed work. [web:263][web:346][web:294][web:273]

When numbers differ—for example between administration claims and independent estimates of removals, or between Mexican government announcements and on‑the‑ground evaluations of programs like “México te abraza”—the discrepancy is spelled out rather than glossed over. Methods, timeframes, and definitions are explained so readers can see why numbers do or do not line up. [web:14][web:11][web:205][web:218][web:298]

No report written by a human being can be perfectly free of bias, and this one is no exception. It reflects an author who lives in Mexico, works with would‑be movers and some deportees, and is committed to the dignity of migrants. That is why critique is not only tolerated but invited: readers are encouraged to send corrections, additional data, or alternative interpretations to PaulGreen@MexicoDeporteeCoalition.com so that future editions can be more accurate, complete, and fair‑minded. [web:293]

### Key Messages: For Donors, Policymakers, and Journalists

**1. The Numbers Do Not Match the Claims**  
Administration figures suggest a historic wave of removals, but careful reading of ICE and DHS data shows that the reality is far below the rhetoric once self‑deportations and survey‑based estimates are stripped out. [web:9][web:289][web:382]

**2. The Focus Is Shifting to Interior Enforcement**  
While previous eras centered on returns at or near the border, the current approach places unprecedented emphasis on arrests and removals from inside U.S. communities, workplaces, and schools, with a much larger share of people taken from settled lives rather than recent arrivals. [web:391][web:376][web:13]

**3. Who Is Being Deported Contradicts Stated Priorities**  
Despite repeated promises to target “criminal aliens,” a large proportion of those detained and removed have either no criminal record or only minor offenses that would not typically be seen as serious public‑safety threats. [web:24][web:383][web:7]

**4. Detention Is Inhumane, Expensive, and Often Unnecessary**  
Independent investigations continue to document medical neglect, solitary confinement, preventable deaths, and extreme psychological harm in immigration detention, even though community‑based alternatives are cheaper and far less damaging. [web:261][web:4][web:2]

**5. 5.9 Million U.S. Citizen Children Are at Risk**  
Millions of citizen children live with at least one undocumented caregiver, and research links forced separation and parental deportation to severe and lasting mental‑health and educational harms that can echo across a lifetime. [web:24][web:4]

**6. The Economy Needs Undocumented Workers**  
Undocumented workers are foundational to sectors like agriculture, construction, and hospitality; large‑scale removals and deterrence measures ripple through labor markets, GDP, and prices in ways that affect U.S.‑born workers as well. [web:13][web:375]

**7. Mexico Is Overwhelmed and Underfunded**  
Mexico has announced programs such as “México te abraza” and expanded reception points, but existing infrastructure and budgets fall far short of what is needed to support large numbers of deportees and returnees in a dignified way. [web:273][web:205][web:348]

**8. The DACA Crisis Is Unprecedented**  
For the first time, a large group of long‑settled residents who have enjoyed lawful presence and work authorization for years face the real possibility of losing both and being removed to countries they barely know. [web:292][web:232][web:347]

**9. Dreamer Reintegration Requires Specialized Support**  
DACA recipients and other “Dreamers” bring U.S. degrees, English‑dominant skills, and deep American roots, which means they face distinct barriers to credential recognition, professional work, and identity rebuilding if deported to Mexico. [web:294][web:273]

**10. Grassroots Resistance Is Mobilizing but Outpaced**  
Rapid response networks, legal defense funds, and local campaigns to limit cooperation with federal enforcement are active across the country, but their capacity remains small compared with the scale of arrests, detentions, and removals. [web:2][web:392]

# PART ONE: HISTORICAL ARCHITECTURE AND POLICY EVOLUTION

## Chapter 1: How We Got Here—Building the Deportation Infrastructure (1965–2024)

### The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965: Unintended Consequences

The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act ended openly racist national‑origins quotas and reshaped the legal immigration system around family ties and limited employment categories, but it did not create sufficient lawful pathways for the volume of labor migration the U.S. economy continued to demand from Mexico and other countries. [web:375][web:20] When the bracero program ended and country caps were imposed, seasonal and circular movement did not vanish; instead, the same flows increasingly occurred without authorization, laying the groundwork for a large undocumented population. [web:375]

### Reagan Era: The Enforcement Turn of the 1980s

The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 combined a one‑time legalization program with new employer sanctions meant to discourage hiring undocumented workers. [web:13][web:375] While roughly 2.7 million people regularized their status, weak workplace enforcement and persistent labor demand meant unauthorized migration continued, and the undocumented population kept growing through the 1990s despite the law’s promises. [web:375]

### The Punitive Turn: IIRIRA (1996)

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 marked a structural break in U.S. immigration enforcement, expanding the grounds of deportability, curtailing judicial discretion, and creating new fast‑track removal procedures. [web:383][web:20] By broadening the definition of “aggravated felony” and applying it retroactively, IIRIRA turned many long‑past and relatively minor convictions into automatic triggers for detention and expulsion, effectively building a pipeline from the criminal legal system into deportation. [web:383][web:389]

### Post‑9/11 Securitization (2001–2008)

After the attacks of September 11, 2001, immigration enforcement was folded into a broader security frame, leading to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the establishment of ICE and CBP, and major investments in surveillance and detention. [web:20][web:383] Programs such as Secure Communities, which linked local police bookings to immigration databases, funneled large numbers of noncitizens into removal proceedings, including many people charged only with minor offenses or none at all. [web:2][web:388]

### Obama Administration: Building Enforcement Capacity (2009–2017)

The Obama administration presided over historically high numbers of removals, with estimates of roughly 2.7 to 3 million deportations over eight years depending on how returns and formal removals are counted. [web:382][web:390] While officials emphasized a focus on people with serious criminal convictions, research shows that many deportees had lived in the United States for a decade or more and that large numbers were removed for immigration violations or lower‑level offenses. [web:24][web:6] At the same time, the administration expanded detention capacity, increased reliance on private prison contractors, and laid down biometric and data‑sharing infrastructures later administrations would inherit. [web:2][web:383]

### Trump’s First Term: Acceleration Without Structural Change (2017–2021)

During Donald Trump’s first term, total removals were lower than the Obama and Clinton eras but the tone and targeting shifted, with more arrests of people who lacked serious criminal records and a heavy emphasis on deterrence messaging. [web:28][web:13][web:385] The administration attempted to terminate DACA, implemented the “zero tolerance” policy that led to widespread family separations at the border, and used Title 42 to rapidly expel asylum seekers during the COVID‑19 pandemic. [web:340][web:4] Although promises of “millions” of deportations were not realized numerically, the threat environment for immigrants intensified and set the stage for later policies. [web:340][web:382]

### Biden Administration: Continuity and Constraint (2021–2024)

The Biden administration inherited pandemic‑era measures and a strained asylum system, initially signaling a narrower enforcement focus but continuing to carry out large numbers of removals and returns, particularly at the border. [web:376][web:28] Public debate often framed Biden’s approach as “open borders,” yet DHS statistics show significant use of expulsions and deportations, including under Title 42 until its end in 2023. [web:9][web:382] Efforts to narrow interior enforcement through guidance were challenged and partly constrained by litigation from certain states, illustrating how much immigration policy now runs through the courts. [web:22][web:343]

### 2025: Trump’s Second Term and the Use of Existing Systems

When Trump returned to office in January 2025, he inherited a robust enforcement architecture: tens of thousands of detention beds, mature data systems linking local police and immigration databases, and legal authorities expanded since the 1990s. [web:11][web:391] Early actions in the second term did not create new legal categories so much as remove prosecutorial discretion and directive limits, signaling that anyone without lawful status could be a target and directing ICE to use its full existing authority. [web:343][web:391] In practice, this has meant a sharper turn toward interior arrests and a more punitive stance toward long‑settled residents, even as total removal numbers remain bounded by capacity, budgets, and due‑process requirements. [web:391][web:289]

---

## Chapter 2: The Numerical Reality—Claims Versus Evidence

### The “Millions Deported” Narrative

Campaign speeches and some official statements portray current enforcement as an unprecedented mass deportation campaign, often citing figures in the millions without clarifying what is being counted. [web:11][web:340] Independent analysts point out that such numbers usually mix formal removals, border returns, voluntary departures, and survey‑based estimates of “self‑deportation,” making it difficult for the public to understand what has actually happened. [web:9][web:382]

### What the Data Show So Far

ICE, CBP, and related DHS components publish removal and apprehension statistics that, while imperfect, allow a clearer picture of recent trends when interpreted carefully. [web:346][web:373] Early 2025 figures indicate that removals have risen compared with the low points of the pandemic and early Biden years and are on track to approach or exceed the higher levels of the mid‑2010s, but they remain below the all‑time peaks reached under Clinton and Obama. [web:9][web:376][web:382] Where the second Trump administration stands out is not total volume alone, but the geographic and legal character of removals—more from the interior, and many involving people with deep ties to U.S. communities. [web:391][web:13]

### Border Returns Versus Interior Removals

Analysts distinguish between “border” removals, usually involving people apprehended soon after entry, and “interior” removals, which involve people arrested after living in the United States for some time. [web:385][web:13] Historical data show that Clinton and Bush presided over very high numbers of border returns, while Obama’s early years and some more recent periods saw relatively more interior removals; under Trump’s second term the balance has again shifted toward the interior, with profound implications for families, workplaces, and local institutions. [web:28][web:391][web:289]

| Administration | Approximate total removals* | Distinctive feature |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clinton | Roughly 12 million (two terms, dominated by border returns). [web:28][web:382] | Built up post‑IIRIRA removal machinery; border‑focused. |
| George W. Bush | Roughly 10 million, mostly border returns. [web:28][web:382] | Post‑9/11 securitization; creation of ICE/CBP. |
| Obama | About 2.7–3 million formal removals, record annual averages. [web:382][web:390] | High interior removals; “deporter in chief” debate. |
| Trump I | Roughly 1.5–2 million removals over one term. [web:28][web:382] | Fewer removals than predecessors but harsher rhetoric. |
| Biden | Around 1.4+ million removals through FY 2024, plus many Title 42 expulsions. [web:9][web:382] | Heavy use of border returns and expulsions. |
| Trump II (early) | Rising removals, with a higher interior share than recent years. [web:391][web:289] | Emphasis on interior enforcement and visibility. |

\*Figures combine formal removals and certain returns, and vary by data source; they are presented here to illustrate relative scale and approach, not as exact counts.

### The Problem of Self‑Deportation and Survey Estimates

Some large figures cited for “departures” rely on surveys asking people whether they have left, plan to leave, or feel less safe, then extrapolate to millions of people assumed to have self‑deported. [web:11][web:382] Social scientists caution that such methods cannot reliably distinguish between actual departures, decisions not to migrate, status adjustments, or simple changes in survey response behavior, and that confidence intervals and response biases make precise claims about self‑deportation highly uncertain. [web:375][web:6]

### Why Accurate Numbers Matter

Understanding the scale and composition of removals is not just an academic exercise; it determines which communities brace for disruption, which school districts prepare for sudden absences, and how both U.S. and Mexican authorities plan for reception and reintegration. [web:13][web:420][web:273] When numbers are inflated, misused, or poorly explained, public debate becomes driven by fear and political theater rather than by realistic assessments of capacity, cost, and human impact. [web:11][web:391] For deportees and their families, the difference between a rhetoric of “millions removed” and the more complex reality can mean the difference between panic and informed preparation.

# PART FOUR: FAMILY DISSOLUTION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA

## Chapter 5: The Children of Deportation—When Americans Lose Parents

### The Scale: Millions of Children at Risk

Analysts estimate that more than 5 million U.S. citizen children live in mixed‑status households where at least one parent lacks lawful immigration status, and many millions more children are close relatives of people at risk of detention o5 depotation.


---### When Detention Becomes the Family’s Center of Gravity

For many families, once a parent is detained, the entire household’s schedule, finances, and emotional energy begin to revolve around that facility. [web:410][web:405] Caregivers must juggle work, childcare, school meetings, and long trips to detention centers, all while trying to keep children informed enough to feel safe but not so overwhelmed that they shut down. [web:406][web:415] Phone calls to detention are often expensive and brief, and children may feel pressure to stay positive on the line even when they are scared or angry, which can make it harder for them to process what is happening. [web:410][web:452]

### The Invisible Work of Caregivers

The parent or relative who remains in the United States often has to become breadwinner, emotional anchor, and legal advocate all at once. [web:405][web:413] Studies describe caregivers taking on multiple jobs, navigating complex court processes in a second language, and managing children’s behavioral changes with little formal support, leading to high levels of burnout and depression among adults as well as children. [web:406][web:417] In mixed‑status families, caregivers may also fear interacting with schools, hospitals, and public agencies, which reduces access to the very services that could help children cope. [web:420][web:458]

### What Children Say They Need

When researchers and clinicians ask directly, children affected by detention and deportation consistently say they want clear information, reassurance that they are not to blame, and spaces where they can talk about what is happening without being judged. [web:452][web:406] Many also ask for practical help—transportation to visit parents, counseling in schools, and adults who understand the immigration system well enough to answer basic questions honestly. [web:417][web:420] These requests point toward interventions that are feasible but not yet widely available: trauma‑informed school supports, low‑cost mental‑health care, and community organizations equipped to walk families through the long aftermath of an enforcement action. [web:413][web:64]

## Chapter 6: The Economic Role of Undocumented Workers

### Why Economics Belongs in a Human Report

Any honest account of deportation has to talk about people’s lives, families, and mental health, but it also has to talk about money. [web:13][web:418] Decisions about how aggressively to enforce immigration law are often justified as economic choices—protecting jobs, wages, or public budgets—so it matters what the numbers actually say. [web:421][web:424] Ignoring the economic dimension leaves the field open to slogans; engaging it carefully shows how closely human dignity and economic reality are tied together.

### How Many Undocumented Workers Are in the Labor Force

Best‑available estimates suggest that several million undocumented immigrants are currently working in the United States, with labor‑force participation rates that are often higher than those of native‑born workers. [web:375][web:414] Because many undocumented people are of prime working age and concentrated in sectors with persistent labor demand, their removal would leave substantial gaps that cannot easily be filled overnight. [web:13][web:418] Even when automation and recruitment of other workers offset some losses over time, the short‑term disruption can be severe for employers, consumers, and local economies.

### Where Undocumented Workers Are Concentrated

Undocumented workers are not spread evenly across the economy; they are clustered in particular industries and occupations. [web:414][web:418] In agriculture and food processing, they plant, harvest, butcher, and package much of the food that ends up on U.S. tables; in construction, they pour concrete, frame houses, and handle roofing and finishing work; in hospitality, they clean hotel rooms, wash dishes, and prep food behind the scenes. [web:414][web:418][web:421] In many of these roles, employers report chronic difficulty recruiting enough authorized workers willing to accept the wages, hours, and conditions on offer.

### Taxes Paid by Undocumented Immigrants

Despite lacking lawful status, undocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars each year in federal, state, and local taxes through payroll withholding, income‑tax filings (often with Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers), property taxes (directly or through rent), and sales taxes. [web:424][web:457] Recent analyses estimate that undocumented immigrants contributed on the order of $30–40 billion annually in state and local taxes nationwide, and close to $100 billion in total federal, state, and local taxes combined. [web:424][web:466][web:462] In several states, undocumented residents’ tax payments exceed what the state spends on services for them, challenging the narrative that they are primarily “takers” from public systems. [web:465][web:459]

### Economic Ripple Effects of Mass Removals

When a significant share of the undocumented workforce is removed or driven into deeper precarity, the immediate effects include lost earnings, business disruption, and reduced consumer spending in neighborhoods where those workers live. [web:13][web:418] Over time, macro‑level models suggest that large‑scale deportations would modestly shrink national GDP, reduce overall employment (because immigrant labor and native‑born jobs are linked), and put upward pressure on prices in sectors like food and housing. [web:13][web:421] These projections vary by model and assumption, but most agree that mass removal is economically costly and that any gains for specific groups of workers are accompanied by broader losses.

### Why This Matters for Policy and Public Opinion

Economic arguments are often used to justify harsh enforcement—claims that undocumented immigrants “steal jobs,” “drive down wages,” or “drain public coffers.” [web:13][web:421] The evidence paints a more complicated picture: undocumented workers are essential to certain industries, contribute significantly in taxes, and have limited effects on native‑born workers’ wages overall, while aggressive removals can damage local economies and public finances. [web:418][web:424][web:457] Recognizing this does not erase the need for immigration law, but it undercuts narratives that depict undocumented people only as burdens and helps explain why both U.S. and Mexican economies are entangled in any serious conversation about deportation.

## Chapter 7: Life After Deportation—What Really Happens

### The Logistics of Removal

The official act of removal—an entry in a database, a tally in a chart—represents only a fraction of what deportation means in real life. [web:261][web:413] In practice, deportees often endure weeks or months in detention, multiple transfers between facilities, and long waits for flights or bus convoys that will take them to Mexico, frequently shackled and with limited access to their belongings. [web:2][web:405] For families, that entire period is experienced as a drawn‑out crisis, not a single event.

### First Hours on the Other Side

Once in Mexico, deportees may find themselves at an official repatriation point—such as Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, Nogales, or Reynosa—or at smaller crossings used for particular flights or bus routes. [web:427][web:430] Mexican authorities and partner organizations may be present to register arrivals, offer water and food, and direct people toward “México te abraza” reception centers or shelters, but coverage is uneven and capacity varies by day and location. [web:205][web:435] Some deportees report being released with only a small amount of cash and no clear guidance on how to reach their home community or secure safe lodging for the night. [web:218][web:439][web:434]

### México te Abraza: Promise and Shortfalls

The “México te abraza” strategy is designed to centralize reception and provide a package of services: temporary shelter, meals, basic medical care, documentation help (such as CURP and identification), and transportation to states of origin. [web:205][web:428] Government statements emphasize the creation of multiple centers along the border and in strategic interior locations, along with coordination with state authorities and social programs meant to integrate returnees into health, education, and employment systems. [web:427][web:437] However, independent reports indicate that many deportees either do not reach these centers, leave quickly, or do not experience them as a meaningful bridge to long‑term stability. [web:218][web:431][web:440]

### On the Streets and in Shelters

In border cities with heavy deportation flows, shelters operated by churches, NGOs, and mutual‑aid groups have long played a central role in receiving deportees, often with minimal funding. [web:434][web:439] These shelters offer beds, meals, basic health care, and sometimes legal or psychological support, but they can become overcrowded, especially when deportations surge or other migration flows converge on the same locations. [web:436][web:442] Deportees who cannot access shelters may end up sleeping in plazas, encampments, or cheap hotels where they are more exposed to extortion, robbery, and recruitment by criminal groups. [web:439][web:441]

### Returning to Interior States

Those who manage to travel on to states such as Guanajuato enter communities with varying levels of formal support. [web:273][web:295] Some state governments have programs to assist return migrants with documentation, schooling for children, and small business development, while others offer only limited services or rely heavily on federal initiatives whose funding may be unstable. [web:422][web:425] Deportees frequently report difficulty translating U.S. work experience into Mexican credentials, confronting employers who see them as risky hires or assume they will soon attempt to leave again. [web:431][web:422]

### Emotional and Spiritual Aftermath

The emotional landscape after deportation is shaped by grief, shame, relief at surviving, anger at perceived injustice, and anxiety about the future—all often existing at once. [web:405][web:413] Men and women who were heads of household in the United States describe feeling that they have failed their families, while also recognizing that the system was stacked against them; many turn to faith communities or informal peer networks for support in the absence of formal counseling. [web:408][web:436] For deportees who land in places like Guanajuato and encounter local residents willing to listen and help, that human welcome can make the difference between spiraling into despair and beginning to rebuild.

## Chapter 8: DACA at a Crossroads

### A Decade of Conditional Security

Since 2012, DACA has allowed hundreds of thousands of young people who were brought to the United States as children to live and work with a measure of protection, but always under the shadow of renewal deadlines and political battles. [web:294][web:347] Recipients have used this window to complete degrees, enter professions, buy homes, and start families, yet their underlying status remains “deferred action”—a promise not to deport that can, in principle, be withdrawn. [web:294][web:234] The last several years of litigation and shifting guidance have underscored how fragile that promise is.

### 2025 Legal Landscape

In 2025, federal court decisions have declared aspects of DACA unlawful while leaving in place injunctions that prevent the government from summarily ending protections for current recipients. [web:232][web:234] The result is a patchwork regime: people who already have DACA can continue to renew it, but new applicants are effectively barred from entering the program even if they meet all the criteria. [web:294][web:429] Legal advocates emphasize that this limbo status puts recipients under constant stress and makes it difficult for employers, universities, and families to plan for the long term. [web:232][web:433]

### Economic and Social Stakes

DACA recipients contribute billions of dollars in wages and taxes each year and are deeply embedded in key sectors such as education, health care, and technology. [web:294][web:347] Many teach in bilingual classrooms, work as nurses or medical aides, or fill hard‑to‑staff roles in rural communities, making their potential loss not just a personal tragedy but a blow to local service capacity. [web:347][web:418] Surveys consistently show high levels of civic engagement among DACA recipients, including volunteering, advocacy, and community leadership, undercutting narratives that portray them as passive beneficiaries. [web:275][web:417]

## Chapter 9: Dreamers as Transnational People

### Belonging on Both Sides of the Border

Dreamers live at the intersection of two national stories: the country that shaped them and the country that claims them on paper. [web:294][web:273] Many were carried across borders as infants or toddlers and have no living memory of their place of birth; others came as school‑age children and remember just enough to feel that they belong partly in both places and fully in neither. [web:24][web:452] This transnational identity can be a source of strength—bilingualism, bicultural fluency, and flexibility—but it also means that policies like DACA, which stop short of citizenship, leave them perpetually half‑recognized.

### Everyday Life Under a Conditional Program

In practical terms, DACA recipients live on two‑year clocks. [web:234][web:294] They must budget for renewal fees, track changing instructions, and watch court decisions that could drastically alter their future with a single ruling; employers and schools must decide how much risk to assume in investing in people whose ability to stay is formally temporary. [web:233][web:433] Psychologists and public‑health researchers link this chronic uncertainty to elevated stress, sleep problems, and symptoms of anxiety and depression, particularly when recipients also carry trauma from earlier family separation or precarious living conditions. [web:61][web:417]

## Chapter 10: If Dreamers Are Deported

### Professional and Educational Disruption

Should DACA collapse entirely or be narrowed in ways that trigger large‑scale deportations or “voluntary departures,” Dreamers would face a tangle of practical obstacles in Mexico. [web:273][web:295] Universities and professional regulators often require extensive paperwork to recognize foreign degrees, including authenticated transcripts, course descriptions, and revalidation exams; this process takes time, costs money, and is not guaranteed to succeed. [web:295][web:422] For a nurse, engineer, or social worker who has built a career in the United States, this can mean an abrupt shift from stable professional identity to underemployment or unemployment.

### Family Decisions Under Pressure

Many DACA recipients are now parents of U.S. citizen children or partners of people with varied statuses; any deportation or forced move would force families into painful choices. [web:420][web:405] Some might decide to keep children in the United States for the sake of schooling and stability, accepting long‑term separation and complicated caregiving arrangements; others might move together to Mexico, where children must adapt to new schools, languages, and social norms. [web:408][web:463] Either choice carries costs, and neither fits the public narrative of deportation as a simple matter of “going back where you came from.”

### Identity, Faith, and the Possibility of Rebuilding

For Dreamers who end up in places like Guanajuato, faith communities, mutual‑aid networks, and projects like The Mexico Deportee Coalition could become critical spaces for making sense of what has happened and imagining new futures. [web:422][web:436] People who have spent years advocating for change in the United States may be uniquely positioned to help others navigate cross‑border systems, build bilingual support groups, and share strategies for turning forced return into a platform for collective action. [web:417][web:413] None of this removes the harm of deportation, but it does point to the possibility that even deeply unjust policies can be met with organized responses rooted in hope and solidarity.

## Toward Solutions: From Crisis to Coalition

The chapters so far have traced how policy decisions in Washington and Mexico City reverberate through detention centers, living rooms, schoolyards, and job sites on both sides of the border. The question that follows is what can be done—not only by governments, but by communities, organizations, and individuals who refuse to accept humiliation and isolation as the last word for deportees and Dreamers. [web:2][web:392][web:205] The remaining sections of this report explore existing forms of resistance, outline practical steps toward a more humane system, and sketch the role that a cross‑border initiative like The Mexico Deportee Coalition—and projects such as a “Deportee Directory” and story‑driven podcast—might play in that larger ecosystem.
